                    Busy Bee RFC was established in 1923 in a poverty stricken area of District 6 and moved to Langa in 1937, where we played social rugby for many years, friendly matches and in Sunday League. The Club was formed by Royal Dairy workers who were from the Eastern Cape.</p>
 
<p>The club has 3 Senior Divisions (First team, Second team, and Third Team), 3 Junior teams (Under 16, Under 19, and Under 21) and it also has 2 Ladies Senior teams and 2 Junior teams. Most of our Junior boys and girls represent Western Province Rugby. The Club is affiliated under Western Province Club Rugby and we playing in the City League. Our main sponsor is Boland Market, hence our 1st team is called Boland Mark. Busy Bee. That is what we offer to our sponsor in return to market their brand.</p>
 
<p>The Club has 5 feeder schools from Langa, and that is where we scout young talent. We also scout some of our players from the Tournaments like Easter Tournament that rotates every year around South Africa depending on the Club that is hosting.</p>   
 
<p>For the past 5 years the Club managed to create a good relationship with Bishops College where our Junior players attend after classes for Maths, Science, English, and rugby skills. They also offer Scholarships to the top students.</p>
 
<p>The Club working together with the sponsor organise residence and jobs to players who are coming from outside Western Cape. We believe by investing in our youth through education, sport which is Rugby, and Life Skills one day they will be better citizens and represent our Country, “a child in sport, is a child out of court!”.</p>
